# Motivation :
### Our motivation was that we wanted to make a website that makes online learing easy were students can learn many different courses and increase their experience by making new projects. Also they can communicate with the instructors and ask them for help. So we started to make this web application to help people

<br></br>

# Description:

### Our project is a learning website were individual trainee can register in it and access any course and start learining. 
### Also we have an admin that gives access to instructors to give courses on the website and give access to corporate trainees to access the website and start learning.
### The Website is based on the MERN stack so we used React.js for the frontend and Node.js and MONGODB for the backend and database
<br></br>

# Setup and Installation :
### To Run the project on your device you need to clone our repositry from github by writing in your terminal :
 `git clone https://github.com/ZiadHegazy/ACL-Project.git`
### Then you should write in the project root folder terminal :
 `cd backend` 

 `npm install`

 `nodemon app.js`
### then again in the root folder terminal :
`cd frontend`

`npm install`

### Then the website will be started and you can use it

<br></br>

# How To Use :
